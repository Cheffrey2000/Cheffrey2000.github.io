A picture is worth a thousand words. Visualizations help to make finding patterns in your data much easier than simply looking at tables or dataframes. In Data Science, we use MatPlotLib in Python to make these visualizations possible. There are other sources as well, but in Python, MatPlotLib is the base for most of these sources. One very useful visualization is the lowly Histogram.
The histogram is a simple visualization that can provide you with a litany of information. Do not let the simplicity of this tool fool you, it is indeed a powerful visualization tool and can provide you with information that may otherwise slip right by you.
When testing a hypothesis, it is helpful to do a quick histogram to see if your data is normally distributed. Doing this will help you to make a quick decision on whether or not you will need to transform your data to begin your analysis. You will be able to see if the data is skewed and in which direction and if it is continuous or categorical. With this information, you can then decide how you will treat your data or if you need to at all.
