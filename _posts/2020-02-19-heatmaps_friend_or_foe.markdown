In Data Science there are many tools in your toolbelt which help you along your path to information enlightenment. You can use graphs, DataFrame information functions such as .describe(), .info(), .head() , correlation matrices or heatmaps. Each of these have their positives and negatives. Today, I would like to discuss the heatmap and the trap it can create to an aspiring data scientist.
Heatmaps are a useful tool in identifying dependent and independent variables or features. A correlation heatmap will allow you to visualize the relationships between all of your features so you are able to decide if you need to use any transformation techniques, feature engineering, or simply drop one of the highly correlated features for your model processing.
