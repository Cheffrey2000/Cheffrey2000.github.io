I find the correlation between being a professional chef (my former career), and a data scientist to fall in line with one another. Each one follows a similar process; take components from a raw state of disarray to a beautiful end result with a well-designed presentation and a final result that is interpreted by the customer. A chef carefully selects ingredients, (meat, produce, herbs, spices), cleans and sanitizes them, slices, dices and cuts them all so each may go through the chosen process of cooking, chilling, or mixing as they are next added to the final presentation which is carefully assembled with the customer's palate in mind.

A Data Scientist gathers the pertinent data, filters through it by removing extraneous values, identifies key components, and applies the appropriate computations to draw out the important information which will be arranged in a presentation of visual graphs and charts. All of this is accompanied with a learned explanation from the Data Scientist to help the stakeholders understand what conclusions will be garnered from the data and suggest future actions based on statistical models and algorithms with the betterment of their business in mind.

When I think of my past experience with being a professional chef, the first thing that comes to mind is in order to create a specialized meal for someone, I must have the finest ingredients for the meal as well as expert knife skills. A chef speaks to their customer though the flavors and textures of a dish; paying attention to the emotion exhibited on their face as they take the first bite as well as how aggressively they attack their last.

A data scientist must also have a clear idea of what their customer may desire in order for a program to have all its working parts align; carefully selecting colors charts and graphs to highlight the important data, while still maintaining the integrity of the data set. To ensure the needs of the stakeholders are met, they need to see how the data can help 
them to grow in the future.

As a chef, data science is in the foundation of the success and profitability of the restaurant. This comes by way of analyzing sales trends, profit and loss statements, and making decisions with stakeholders if a dish should remain on the menu or not, and pure customer satisfaction is at the forefront for both careers. Each professional must also choose whether to follow trends or to step out of the norm and show their skills by thinking outside the box. From preparation to presentation- a chef and a data scientist specialize in the creation of output focusing on customer satisfaction and understanding.

**PREPARATION**
To get to a finalized beautiful plate, the chef must first select his ingredients. looking over each piece of protein, weighing, smelling, trimming, and scrutinizing each produce selection for color and freshness. The chef sometimes will choose products already made such as mayo, pickles, spice blends and sauces using his expertise to select them from trusted sources to ensure quality. Each ingredient is then run through a process of cleaning, trimming and cutting to fit within the vision of the chef.

The data scientist has a similar workflow using different components: graphs, visuals, codes, oral presentation, and actual data. Using formats already created by others and adapting my own code is apply the appropriate functions from Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. Using Jupyter as my sauté pan each function and method is called into action filtering, removing extraneous values and creating sets of data to bring the pertinent information t the surface.

**CREATION**
With impeccable ingredients comes an artful creation, the smell of each component inspires dishes and techniques that fuel the chef's soul. The tools of a chef are also paramount, using the proper pan with great heat transfer or retention to get the perfect sear, a well-cared for knife to ensure precision cuts when applied to the most delicate ingredients as it glides through with each stroke. The tools of the chef allow the creation to come to fruition as each technique is applied and tool used the dish slowly passes through each stage of inspection as the chef tastes and adjusts to ensure his vision is conveyed in that final plate.

A data scientist combs through data, organizing, graphing and filtering to understand what the data is trying to say. Then through applying the toolbelt of methods, functions, and commands from different packages available; checking constantly to ensure the outcome is what is desired. As the data is broken into its manageable pieces and displayed artfully with graphs and charts, the data scientist is well on his way to putting together a presentation for the stakeholders that will enlighten them and show a path for growth and profitability.

**PRESENTATION**
A chef's final presentation is a well composed plate that includes a protein or main dish, sides such as vegetables, and then a garnish. Once prepared the components are expertly assembled on the chosen plate, arranged artfully to highlight the care taken with the tools applied to these beautiful ingredients. Finally, the dish is whisked away by a well-trained server who takes pride in placing the dish in front of the guest so they can feast with their eyes on the delectable creation before them with the perfect temperature, texture and colors to excite their senses.

A data scientist will carefully compose a visually stunning presentation with explicit graphs containing just enough information to point out the highlights while keeping the audience riveted to his every word. He will describe the trends that have presented themselves, describe the outliers and how they were treated and hone in on the meat of the project to point out the information that became of the in depth analysis. Armed with different sets, the data scientist will point out what conclusions he has drawn and what those may mean for the future of the organization and its stakeholders.

**CLOSING**
With the many parallels between the two disciplines, I am ready to begin my journey carrying my experience as a seasoned chef into the realm of ones and zeros, creating recipes to extract data and transform it into delicate bite sized pieces for everyone to consume and enjoy the fruits of my labor. From the preparation to the presentation, I will enjoy the creation process no matter the audience, platform or medium. I look forward to cooking up some data in the near future and maybe others have discovered they too are already suited for data science.
